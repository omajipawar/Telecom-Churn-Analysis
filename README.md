# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Analyzing Telecom Churn Dataset.

The main objective of the project is to Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.

I divided the whole project in diffrent parts and analyzed data:

1.Churn according to voicemail plan

2.Churn according to international plan

3.Area wise churn analysis

4.Churn according to charges

5.Churn according to customer care calls

6.State wise churn analysis

Following are the conclusions got after doing EDA on the dataset:

There are about 85% customers who churn out, and about 14.49% customers retained.

Loyal Customers are more than that of customers who churns.

Voicemail plan seems to be popular with the customers.

Churn rate of Customers with Voice mail plan is about 8%.

While Churn rate of Customers who don't have voice mail plan is about 16%

Most of the churned customers are from 415 area.

While Area codes 408 and 510 had comparatively less churned customers.

Churn rate is more with customer using international plan.

Customers with International plan have about 42% Churn rate.

While customers who don't have International plan have about 11% Churn rate.

Day time call chargers is a significant reason to leading to customer Churn.

Higher number of customer calls increases the possibility of customer churn.

The highest Customer churn is in TX and NJ states that is of 18.

Call minutes and call charges are highly correlated.

Recommendations to ensure customer retention:


Telecom company needs to monitor the service quality, try to solve a technical problem in less than three calls.

Treated day calls customers as valued customers. Target these high usage customers with price promotions.

Promotion for voice mail plans.

Overall charge comparison should be done with other competitors.

Promotion for international call customers who use more(collaborate with internet options like skype etc).

Decreasing the prices as the talk-time increases can be an effective way to reduce the churn.
